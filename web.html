<div class="Kerala" id="Kerala">
<p style="background-color: white" > Kerala , is a state on the Malabar Coast of India 
It was formed on 1 November 1956, following the passage of the States Reorganisation Act, by combining Malayalam-speaking 
regions of the erstwhile regions of Cochin, 
Malabar, South Canara, and Travancore.Spread over 38,863 km2

 Kerala is the 21st largest Indian state by area. It is bordered by Karnataka to the north and northeast,
  Tamil Nadu to the east and south, and the Lakshadweep Sea[18] to the west. With 33 million 
 inhabitants as per the 2011 census, Kerala is the 13th-largest Indian state by population.
 
  It is divided into 14 districts with the capital being Thiruvananthapuram. Malayalam is the most widely spoken 
 language and is also the official language of the state.</p>
 <p style="background-color: white">The Chera dynasty was the first prominent kingdom based in Kerala. The Ay kingdom in the deep south and 
 the Ezhimala kingdom in the north formed the other kingdoms in the early years of the Common Era (CE).
  The region had been a prominent spice exporter since 3000 BCE.
  The region's prominence in trade was noted in the works of Pliny as well as the Periplus around 100 CE. In the 15th century, the spice trade attracted Portuguese traders to Kerala, and paved the way for European colonisation of India. At the time of Indian independence movement in the early 20th century,
  there were two major princely states in Kerala: Travancore and Cochin. </p>

<div class="cuisine">
<p> Kerala cuisine is a culinary style originated in the Kerala, a state on the southwestern Malabar Coast of India. 
Kerala cuisine offers a multitude of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes prepared using fish, poultry and red meat
 with rice as a typical accompaniment. Chillies,
 curry leaves, coconut, mustard seeds, turmeric, tamarind, asafoetida and other spices are also used in the preparation.</p>
 <p> Kerala is known as the "Land of Spices" because it traded spices with Europe as well as with many ancient civilizations 
 with the oldest historical records of the Sumerians from 3000 BCE</p>
 <p>One of the traditional Kerala dishes is vegetarian and is called the Kerala sadya.
  A full-course sadya, consists of rice with about 20 different accompaniments and desserts, and is the ceremonial meal of Kerala eaten usually on celebratory occasions including weddings, Onam and Vishu. It is served on a plantain leaf.

Because of its rich trading heritage, over time, various indigenous Kerala dishes have been blended with foreign 
dishes to adapt them to local tastes. Coconuts grow in abundance in Kerala, so grated coconut and coconut milk are 
commonly used for thickening and flavouring.[4]

Kerala's long coastline and numerous rivers have led to a strong fishing industry in the region, making seafood a 
common part of meals. Rice is grown in abundance along with tapioca. It is the main starch ingredient used in Kerala's food.

Having been a major production area of spices for thousands of years, the region makes frequent use of black pepper, cardamom,
 clove, ginger, and cinnamon. Kerala also has a variety of breakfast dishes like idli, dosa, appam, idiyappam, puttu, and  pathiri</p>
        <p>A dosa is a thin, savoury crepe in South Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground white gram and rice. Dosas
         are served hot, 
        often with chutney and sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew). Dosas are popular in South Asia as well as around the world.</p>
        <p>In popular tradition, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish's association with Udupi
         restaurants.[3] The Tamil dosa is traditionally softer and thicker; the thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in
          present-day Karnataka.[4] A recipe for dosa can be found 
        in Manasollasa, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.[5]</p>

 <div><p> Kochi is a town and hill station located in the Idukki district of the southwestern Indian state of Kerala. 
 Munnar is situated at around 1,600 metres (5,200 ft) above mean sea level,
 in the Western Ghats mountain range. Munnar is also called the "Kashmir of South India" and is a popular honeymoon destination</p>
 
  <p>The region has been inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribals like the 
  Malayarayan and Muthuvan for thousands of years. In the early days,
   only Tamils and few Malayalis lived there. They were brought as workers in
    the tea plantations .Tradition states that Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later
     the Duke of Wellington, was the first British person to pass through Munnar
      during Tippu Sultan's campaign in Travancore, but this is unsubstantiated.
       The first survey of the terrain was undertaken by Benjamin Swayne Ward in 1816–1817,
        who followed the Periyar into the Western Ghats and established a camp at the
   confluence of three rivers, from which the name of Munnar is derived.
  </p>
  <p>It was to be nearly 50 years later that Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras, 
 instructed Col. Douglas Hamilton to explore the hill country in the western part of the
  Madras Presidency, requesting special advice on the feasibility of establishing sanatoria 
  for the British in the South and of developing revenue- earning projects without endangering 
  the environment, as had happened in Ceylon where coffee had destroyed not only the rain forest 
  but also paddy cultivation in the north-central rice bowl of ancient Ceylon. Hamilton climbed 
  throughout the Ghats in Munnar region. 15 years later, John Daniel Munro noted that much of 
  Munnar's land was suitable for coffee plantations. Munro, Henry Turn and his half-brother AW 
  Turner obtained ownership of the Cardamom Hills from the Raja of Travancore and began clearing
  forest around Devikulam in 1879. Soon many other Europeans began establishing tea plantations 
  in the area throughout the 1880s.Early plantations had few facilities and were mainly huts of straw.
 </p>
<p>Eventually roads were opened to the lowlands and in Bodinayakanur in western Madras Presidency,
 planters got provisions from a local headman - Suppan Chetty. He and his son, Alaganan Chetty
  (later an MLA) would continue providing supplies to the tea estates in the region. By 1894, 
  26 estates were established in the hills but all were facing losses. In 1897, a separate company,
   Kannan Devan Hills Corporation (KDHC) was registered to operate the tea estates which was later 
   taken over by the American Direct Tea Trading Company Ltd., who owned 26 estates, most with coffee
    and some with cinchona, 
almost all in the area except for a few in the lower areas.
</p>
<p>In 1900, a ropeway was built and eventually monorails were installed for easier transport of goods
 to the plains. In 1901, P. R. Buchanan took over as General Manager and began the most extensive clearing
  of jungles for plantations. In 1908, construction started on a new railway which opened in 1909. By 1911,
   around 16,000 acres of the region was under cultivation.

In 1924, a flood swept through Munnar, damaged the road and destroyed the rail track. In its place it was 
decided to create a ropeway to transport tea. In 1930, this in turn was replaced by a modern road that made
 transport much easier. By 1952, almost 28,000 acres of land was under cultivation. After Independence,
  Indian planters took over. In 1964, the KDHC which owned most tea estates was acquired by Tata and Finlay 
  who started the first instant tea factory in the country. In 1971, the Kerala government wanted to reforest 
  all land in the hills not used for plantations. However negotiations that followed resulted in Tata keeping 
  most of the land, leaving it with 57,000 acres.
